## Project Plan


1. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan. (Can be same as previous turn-in, but updated if you changed your plan)

2. Functioning project: The finished project should be a device, system, interface, etc. that people can interact with.

3. Documentation of design process

4. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)

5. Video of someone using your project
6. 


Big Idea:  An interactive art installation, LuminArt features a multi-tiered acrylic canvas that transforms with the viewers' movements. It's composed of 15 acrylic layers, each framed by responsive LED lighting, and driven by motion sensors and servo motors. These elements work together to shift the layers, creating a live, evolving visual as people interact with the piece.

Specific Application:  The installation showcases the possibilities of merging traditional artistic mediums with cutting-edge technology. It serves as an example of how innovation can enhance and redefine our understanding of art.

Project Plan Highlights: Nov 14: Idea pitch. Nov 20: Design and gather materials. Nov 27: Build and test the prototype. Dec 4: Finish painting and tweak the LEDs.

Parts and resources needed: Raspberry Pi, 15+ acrylic boards, LED strip, paints, power supply,
sensors, wires, mounting materials.

Expected Challenges: LED interaction would not be as precise as we expected.

Contribution Overview: Split evenly. Do every part together in person.

Feedback Sought: How to make the interaction intuitive to user/



**Idea:** LuminArt Interactive Painting

Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.

* Outline:
    The LuminArt Interactive Canvas is a multi-layered acrylic painting installation with integrated LED lighting, designed to respond to audience body movement. 
    
    The main components include a 15-layer acrylic painting, an LED strip surrounding the painting, and motion sensors for interaction.

* Parts Needed:
    Raspberry Pi (including SD card, power supply)
    Acrylic Boards (15+)
    LED Strip 
    Acrylic Paints
    Power supply
    Motion sensors (infrared or camera-based) or camera
    Wires and electronic components for connections
    Structural materials for mounting (plywood, brackets, etc.)

* Prototype and Test:
    The prototype will consist of a sturdy frame to hold the background and multiple layer of paintings. 
    
    The mechanism for switching layers will be controlled by motion sensors. As the audience moves, the sensors will detect the motion, initiating the switch between different views on the painting. 
    
    The prototype will undergo testing to ensure smooth transitions, accurate motion detection, and durability. Test scenarios will involve different audience sizes and movement patterns to simulate real-world interactions.
    
* Project Plan:
    * **Timeline:**
    Week 1: Conceptualization and design planning. Acquire materials (acrylic boards, LED strips, motion sensors).
    Week 2: Build the physical prototype and test basic functionality. 
    Week 3: Paint the rest of layers of the acrylic boards and refine the LED circuit based on test results.
    Week 4: Final assembly, documentation, and video creation.
   
* Fall-Back Plan: 

    Start with 1 layer where we would confirm the feasibility of servo interaction with movements.
    
    In case of technical difficulties or budget constraints, simplify the design while maintaining the core interactive concept.

## Outline
Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project plan - November 14

Peer feedback on Project plans: November 21

Functional check-off - November 28 & 30

Final Project Presentations - December 5 & 7

Write-up and documentation due - December 14

## Objective

The goal of this final project is for you to have a fully functioning and well-designed interactive device of your own design.
 
## Description
Your project is to design and build an interactive device to suit a specific application of your choosing, and *test the interaction with people*. 

## Deliverables

1. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.
    
    

2. Functioning project: The finished project should be a device, system, interface, etc. that people can interact with.

3. Documentation of design process
4. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
5. Video of someone using your project
6. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

7. Group work distribution questionnaire

## Change of Design

It is fine to change your project goals, but please resubmit the project plan for the new design when you do that.

## Grading rubric

20% Project planning: Allocation of needed resources (time, people, materials, facilities) anticipated well.
20% Design of project: Interaction, hardware and software aspects of projects planned well.
20% Testing of project: Functional or wizarded system tested with people
20% Prototype functionality: System capable of interaction, either through autonomous or wizarded mechanisms
20% Project documentation: Text, video, and photo of project illustratign capability and documenting plans and process

## Teams

You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.
